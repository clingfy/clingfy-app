# TODOS

Deferred work captured during reviews. Each item has enough context to pick up cold.

## Editor — clip lane

### Persistent scissors tool mode (Premiere-style razor)
- **What:** A button-activated cut tool that stays active across multiple cuts without holding a modifier.
- **Why:** Some users coming from Premiere/Final Cut expect a sticky "blade" tool (select tool ↔ razor tool).
- **Context:** Deferred in the 2026-06-28 eng review of the scissors-split feature. We shipped modifier-click instead (hold Option → cut at pointer) because a persistent opaque overlay fought the timeline's scroll/pan and the trim-handle gestures, and put interaction state in lib/core where it didn't belong. The modifier-click approach delivers the same cut-at-pointer with none of those conflicts. See the design doc `*-scissors-split-design-*.md` in the gstack project dir for the full rationale (objections 1-4).
- **Pros:** Familiar to pro-editor users; no key to hold for long cutting sessions.
- **Cons:** Modal UX (the friction casual users complain about); reintroduces the gesture-conflict landmines the modifier approach avoided.
- **Start at:** `lib/app/home/preview/widgets/video_timeline.dart` (mode state would live local in `_VideoTimelineState`, next to `_panModeEnabled`), `lib/app/home/preview/widgets/timeline/timeline_editor_viewport.dart` (a non-opaque hit layer inside `TimelineScrollableCanvas`).
- **Depends on:** The modifier-click cut layer landing first (this is its evolution).
- **Gate:** Only build on real user demand.

### Frame-preview (previewPeekTo) on the clip lane during cut-hover
- **What:** Extend the hover→`previewPeekTo` pipeline to the clip-lane region, not just the ruler, while cut-hovering.
- **Why:** Today hover-peek is wired only on the ruler strip (`timeline_editor_viewport.dart:489-494`). With modifier-click cutting, hovering the lane shows a guide line but not the actual frame you're about to cut on — so cuts on the lane area are "blind."
- **Context:** Raised by the outside-voice review (2026-06-28). Enhancement, not required for the scissors-split feature to work.
- **Pros:** You see the exact frame under the cut point anywhere on the timeline, not just on the ruler.
- **Cons:** More hover→native traffic on the lane; needs the same coalescing/peek-end hardening the ruler path already has.
- **Start at:** `lib/app/home/preview/widgets/video_timeline.dart` (`onHoverSeek`/`previewPeekTo` wiring), `lib/app/home/preview/widgets/timeline/timeline_editor_viewport.dart`.
- **Depends on:** Scissors-split cut layer (shares the cut-hover state).

## Windows — bridge routers

### Camera-composition arg-parsing dedupe (shared Bridge/Routers helper)
- **What:** Extract the duplicated camera-composition parsing (`preview_router.cpp` `ReadCameraComposition` + `export_router.cpp` `HandleProcessVideo`) into one shared `Bridge/Routers` helper, following the `color_grade_args` pattern.
- **Why:** The duplication already hid a missing-chroma bug once (caught in the 9.7 review). Two parsers for one wire shape will drift again.
- **Context:** Deferred in the 2026-07-03 eng review of the color-grade port (editing step 2). PR-2a introduces `Bridge/Routers/color_grade_args.{h,cpp}` — one parser used by both routers — which is exactly the shape the camera parsing should adopt. Deferred because touching two hot routers for zero user-visible change would widen an already-full color slice.
- **Pros:** Kills the parser-drift bug class for camera args; makes the routers smaller.
- **Cons:** Pure refactor — no user-visible change; needs careful diffing of the two existing parsers (they may have drifted already, which is the point).
- **Start at:** `windows/runner/Bridge/Routers/preview_router.cpp` (`ReadCameraComposition`), `windows/runner/Bridge/Routers/export_router.cpp` (`HandleProcessVideo` camera block); model on `Bridge/Routers/color_grade_args.{h,cpp}` once PR-2a lands.
- **Depends on:** PR-2a (color_grade_args establishes the pattern).
- **Effort:** human ~2h / CC ~15min.
